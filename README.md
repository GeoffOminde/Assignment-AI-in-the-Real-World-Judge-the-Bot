# Responsible AI Inspector 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to your mission as a **Responsible AI Inspector**! In this project, you’ll investigate how AI is being used in real-life scenarios, spot potential issues, and suggest improvements to make AI safer, fairer, and more transparent.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Your job is to:

1. Describe what an AI system is doing.
2. Identify potential problems (bias, privacy, accountability, transparency).
3. Suggest **one actionable improvement**.
4. Bonus: Present your findings in a **fun, blog-style write-up**.

Think of yourself as a detective uncovering the hidden impact of AI in everyday situations.

---

## 🗂️ Example Scenarios

Here are some sample prompts to get you started:

- **Hiring Bot:** AI screens job applications. Problem: tends to reject female applicants with career gaps.
- **School Proctoring AI:** AI flags students for cheating based on eye movement. Problem: disproportionately flags neurodivergent students.

---

## 📝 Deliverables

For each case, provide:

1. **What’s happening:** A short description of how the AI works.
2. **What’s problematic:** Explain the risks or issues (bias, fairness, privacy, etc.).
3. **Improvement idea:** Suggest one way to make the AI responsible.
4. **Bonus:** Blog-style explanation — clear, fun, and engaging.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Steps to Complete

1. **Choose 2 AI scenarios** (provided or find your own).
2. **Investigate the AI behavior.**
3. **Analyze potential risks.**
4. **Propose one improvement per scenario.**
5. **Write your short blog posts** (optional, but earns bonus points).
6. **Compile your write-ups** into a single document.

## 🖋 Example Submission Format

**Scenario 1: Hiring Bot**  
- **What’s happening:** AI screens resumes and ranks applicants.  
- **What’s problematic:** Rejects more female applicants with career gaps. Risk of gender bias.  
- **Improvement idea:** Include bias-detection checks and anonymize career gap data.  
- **Blog-style snippet:**  
> Imagine an AI recruiter with tunnel vision. It doesn’t see potential, only gaps. Our fix? Teach it to look beyond the resume and judge skills, not stereotypes.  

**Scenario 2: School Proctoring AI**  
- **What’s happening:** Monitors students' eye movements during tests.  
- **What’s problematic:** Flags neurodivergent students as cheating. Risk of unfair treatment.  
- **Improvement idea:** Adjust detection thresholds and allow manual review.  
- **Blog-style snippet:**  
> Our AI eye spy might have a blind spot. Neurodivergent students blink differently — and get wrongly accused! Let’s give teachers the final say.
