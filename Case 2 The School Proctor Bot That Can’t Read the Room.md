What’s happening:
Some schools are using an AI to watch students during online exams. If a student looks away from the screen too much or fidgets, the AI flags them for “cheating.” Sounds helpful, right? Not really.

What’s problematic:
Many students move differently especially those with ADHD, anxiety, or other neurodivergent conditions. The bot doesn’t know that. It just sees "weird movement" and raises an alarm. So, students get punished for being themselves, not for cheating.

One way to fix it:
The AI needs to be trained with more diverse examples of how students behave. And schools should always have a real teacher or staff member review any red flags before taking action. A machine shouldn’t make the final call on its own.
