What’s happening:
A company is using a computer program (an AI) to help choose who to call for job interviews. It looks through hundreds of applications and picks out the ones it “thinks” are best. But here’s the catch it keeps rejecting women who took breaks from work, like for raising kids.

What’s problematic:
That’s not fair at all. Just because someone took time off doesn’t mean they can’t do the job. The bot is copying patterns from old hiring data, and if that old data was unfair to women, the AI becomes unfair too. It’s like teaching a kid using a bad book they’ll repeat the same mistakes.

One way to fix it:
Train the AI using better, fairer examples like resumes from people who had career breaks but still did great work. Also, let real people double-check the bot’s choices to make sure it’s not being unfair.
